# DiningPhilosophersProblem SYCL

# What is the code doing
This code is implementing the Dining Philosophers problem, a classic example of a synchronization problem in computer science. The problem describes a group of philosophers who share a round table and each of them needs two forks to eat.

The code starts by defining the number of philosophers (num_philosophers) and a boolean variable done to signal the end of the simulation. It then defines the philosopher function, which takes an ID number and a vector of atomic boolean variables representing the state of each fork.

Inside the philosopher function, the left and right forks of the philosopher are determined based on their ID number. The philosopher enters an infinite loop until the simulation is done. In each iteration, the philosopher tries to pick up the left fork and then the right fork using a compare-and-swap operation (compare_exchange_weak). If a fork is not available, the philosopher yields the thread, which allows other threads to run.

Once the philosopher has both forks, it eats for a brief period, represented by a call to std::this_thread::sleep_for. Then it puts down both forks and thinks for another brief period before starting the next iteration.

The main function initializes the forks vector to have num_philosophers false values (i.e., representing that no fork is currently being used) and creates a vector of threads, each running the philosopher function with a different ID and passing in a reference to the forks vector. After waiting for 5 seconds, the done variable is set to true to signal the end of the simulation. Finally, the join method is called on each thread to wait for them to finish before exiting the program.

# Conclusion
The program demonstrates a solution to the Dining Philosophers problem using atomic variables and threads in C++. The solution ensures that no two adjacent philosophers can eat at the same time by implementing a strict ordering of fork acquisitions.

Each philosopher tries to acquire the left fork first and then the right fork. If a philosopher cannot acquire both forks, it releases any forks it has and tries again. The use of atomic variables ensures that only one philosopher can acquire a fork at a time.

The program uses threads to simulate each philosopher's actions and runs them concurrently. The program runs until a done flag is set, which signals the philosophers to stop eating and exit the loop.

Overall, the program provides a simple and effective solution to the Dining Philosophers problem using atomic variables and threads.

# What are atomic variable and threads in SYCL
SYCL is a framework for implementing heterogeneous computing applications using C++. It is designed to allow developers to write high-performance code that can run on different devices such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

Atomic variables in SYCL are a type of variable that can be accessed and modified atomically, which means that multiple threads can access them without causing data races or inconsistencies. Atomic variables provide a way to ensure that shared data is updated atomically, even in a concurrent programming environment.

SYCL also provides support for multi-threading through the use of threads. A thread is a lightweight execution unit that can run concurrently with other threads in a program. In SYCL, threads are used to implement parallelism, allowing different parts of a program to execute simultaneously on different devices or processor cores.

SYCL provides a high-level abstraction for threading through its execution and kernel objects. The execution object represents a queue of commands that can be executed on a device, while the kernel object represents a single function that can be executed as a thread.

Overall, atomic variables and threads are important concepts in SYCL for implementing high-performance parallel computing applications that can take advantage of multiple devices and processors.
